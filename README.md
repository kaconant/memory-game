## Memory Game 

![memory](https://github.com/kaconant/memory-game/blob/master/public/img/memorygame.png) <!-- .element height="50%" width="50%" -->

This application was created with the Create-React-App. It was an exercise to use logic to create a matching card game as well as practice routing, switching, and linking within a real-world application. 

The card game will only keep the icons flipped if you've found a match. Otherwise, they will time out and spin back over.
